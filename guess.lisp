;; **************** -*- Summary -*- ****************
;; *                   Chapter 1                   *
;; *  In this chapter, we discussed the different  *
;; * dialects of Lisp and installing CLISP. You    *
;; * learned the following along the way:          *
;; *                                               *
;; * - There are two main dialects of Lisp: Common *
;; * Lisp and Scheme. Both have a lot to offer,    *
;; * but weâ€™ll focus on Common Lisp in this book.  *
;; *                                               *
;; * - Common Lisp is a multiparadigm language,    *
;; * meaning that it supports many different       *
;; * programming styles.                           *
;; *                                               *
;; * - CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation that  *
;; * is easy to set up, making it a great choice   *
;; * for a Lisp novice.                            *
;; *                                               *
;; * - You can type in Lisp commands directly from *
;; * the CLISP REPL.                               *
;; *************************************************
;; *                   Chapter 2                   *
;; *  In this chapter, we discussed the basic      *
;; * Common Lisp commands for defining variables   *
;; * and functions. Along the way, you learned the *
;; * following:                                    *
;; *                                               *
;; * - To define a global variable, use the        *
;; * defparameter command.                         *
;; *                                               *
;; * - To define a global function, use the defun  *
;; * command.                                      *
;; *                                               *
;; * - Use the let and flet commands to define     *
;; * local variables and functions, respectively.  *
;; *                                               *
;; * - The function labels is like flet, but it    *
;; * lets functions call themselves. Functions     *
;; * that call themselves are called recursive     *
;; * functions.                                    *
