## Land-of-Lisp
This repository have the objective to develop some programs of the book "*Land of Lisp*", author _Conrad Barski, M. D._.

At the same time this repository pretend to give a abstract of each chapter of the book on the subdirectory README.md.

# Chapter 1 - Getting started with Lisp

## Section I - Lisp is Power
# Chapter 2 - Creating your first Lisp Program
- To define global variable, use defparameter command
- To define glbal function, use the defun command
- Use the let and flet commands to define local variables and functions, respectively
- The function labels is like flet, but lets functions call themselves. Functions that call themselves are called recursive functions.

# Chapter 3 - Explore the syntax of Lisp Code

- Parentheses in Lisp are there to keep the the amount of syntax to a minimum;
- Lists are created from cons cells;
- You can create lists by making cons cells with the cons command;
- You can inspect the pieces of a list with car and cdr;
