## Land-of-Lisp
This repository have the objective to develop some programs of the book "*Land of Lisp*", author _Conrad Barski, M. D._.

At the same time this repository pretend to give a abstract of each chapter of the book inside README.md.

## Section I - Lisp is Power
# Chapter 1 - Getting started with Lisp
In this chapter, we discussed the different dialects of Lisp and installing CLisp. You learned the following along the way:
- There are two main dialects of Lisp: Common Lisp and Scheme. Both have a lot to offer, but we'll focus on Common Lisp in this book.
- Common Lisp is a miltiparadigm language, meaning that it suport many different programming styles.
- CLisp ia a Common Lisp implementation that is easy to set up, making it a great choice for a Lisp novice.
- You can type in Lisp commands directly from the CLisp REPL.

# Chapter 2 - Creating your first Lisp Program
In this chapter, we discussed the basic Common Lisp commands for defining variables and functions. Along the way, you learned the following:
- To define global variable, use *defparameter* command.
- To define glbal function, use the *defun* command.
- Use the *let* and *flet* commands to define local variables and functions, respectively.
- The function *labels* is like flet, but lets functions call themselves. Functions that call themselves are called _recursive_ functions.

# Chapter 3 - Explore the syntax of Lisp Code

- Parentheses in Lisp are there to keep the the amount of syntax to a minimum;
- Lists are created from cons cells;
- You can create lists by making cons cells with the cons command;
- You can inspect the pieces of a list with car and cdr;
